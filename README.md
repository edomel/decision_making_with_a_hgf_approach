# translational_neuromodeling_project

The code in this repository is organized in this way:

There are two branches of experiment.
These execute the same experiment in different orders.

There is a computations folder.
It is is done here all the preprocessing for the collected data before the hgf.
There is also some code simulating the experiment with different approaches and its results are fitted too.
It is a big folder as here are stored also all the results of further computations on the data.

There is a folder for the collected data.
The data we could collect and process in our experiment is saved in this folder.

The tapas folder contains the functions for the hgf implemented by the TNU in Zurich.
There has also been added here the code for the fitting and saving of our data.

The deterministic annealing clustering file is a jupyter notebook file instead of a matlab one as the others.
It performs deterministic annealing clustering on the collected data.
The code is already initialized with the data obtained in our experiment but is completely reusable.
